# Implementation Plan — custom-wysiwyg-editor

The what/next roadmap: phases, status spine, and the arc. **Update checkboxes and the
spine whenever work lands.** Architecture invariants live in the root `CLAUDE.md`
(one concern, one home); the agent-integration contract lives in
`integration/PLAN.md`; *now* lives in the root `CONTEXT.md`.

## Vision

A custom WYSIWYG library built for **compatibility** — embeds on a plain website
with a `<script>` tag, first-class React/Next.js + TypeScript support, exports to
Markdown and HTML (including aligned text) — evolving toward a **Notion-like
editing experience**, with a clean **agent-integration seam** so external agents
(AI or otherwise) drive edits through the same pure-command door as keystrokes.

## Status spine

| Domain | Status | One line |
|---|---|---|
| `core` | ✓ | engine (model/commands/view/input rules/parseHTML) — **Phases 2–4 complete**: tree, paths, full block set incl. tables, block chrome, rich paste. `core/SPEC.md` |
| `formatting` | ✓ | text styling & alignment — full mark set shipped (bold/italic/code/link, color/highlight/fontSize/fontFamily, custom color pickers, bubble palette); block indent resolved as won't-build (nesting is the mechanism). `formatting/SPEC.md` |
| `integration` | ✓ | the agent-adapter seam — pipe proven, `@custom-wysiwyg/agent-adapter` shipped (context out, undoable markdown/stream edits in), scripted demo session; open: first live LLM pass. `integration/PLAN.md` |
| ui | ✓ | framework-free widgets (BubbleMenu, SlashMenu) — no folder yet; mint when it grows rules |
| react | ✓ | bindings (`useEditor`/`<Editor>`, SSR-safe) — no folder yet |
| export | ✓ | markdown + html serializers + markdown importer — no folder yet |

## Phase 0 — Walking skeleton ✅ (done)

- [x] Monorepo: core / react / export-markdown / export-html (+ ui added in Phase 1)
- [x] Document model: paragraphs, headings h1–h3, marks (bold/italic/code/link), block alignment
- [x] Editing: typing, Enter, Backspace/Delete with cross-block merge, plain-text paste, undo/redo with typing coalescing, IME composition, stored marks
- [x] Markdown + HTML export; aligned blocks fall back to inline HTML in Markdown
- [x] React bindings: `useEditor` / `<Editor>`, `'use client'` baked in, SSR-safe
- [x] CI (GitHub Actions), vanilla demo page, Chromium smoke tests

## Phase 1 — Notion feel ✅ (done)

- [x] Slash menu (`/` palette: filter, arrows, Enter, Esc; extensible items)
- [x] Bubble toolbar above selections with active states
- [x] Markdown input rules: `# `→h1…h3, `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `` `code` ``
- [x] Placeholder text; editor event system (`change`/`update`/`focus`/`blur`)
- [x] `@custom-wysiwyg/ui` is framework-free; React wrappers `<BubbleMenu>`/`<SlashMenu>`
- Polish debt cleared: link now has an inline in-bubble editor; undo after autoformat restores the literal `**` syntax (see Ongoing track)

## Phase 2 — Structure (next up)

The one genuinely architectural step. Do this before adding more block types.
Rules to respect while doing it: `core/SPEC.md`.

- [x] Migrate model from flat block list to a **recursive block tree**; positions become paths (`{ path: number[], offset }`) — inline spans now `content`, nested blocks `children`
- [x] Update all commands + selection mapping (`data-path`) + both exporters for the tree (exporter nesting semantics provisional until list types define them)
- [x] Bulleted / numbered lists (`listItem` blocks with `kind`, Tab/Shift+Tab indent via tree nesting, input rules `- `/`* `/`1. `, Enter/Backspace exit-and-outdent, slash items, `<ul>/<ol>` grouping in HTML, tight indented Markdown lists)
- [x] To-do blocks (checkbox, click-to-toggle), blockquotes, code blocks (verbatim: no marks/rules, Enter = newline, double-Enter exits), dividers (void block), callouts (emoji attr)
- [x] Extend slash-menu items + exporters for each new type (GFM tasks, `>` quotes, fences, `---`, emoji-quote callouts; HTML: task `<ul>`, `<blockquote>`, `<pre><code>`, `<hr>`, `<aside>`)

## Phase 3 — Tables

- [x] Table node (rows → cells → inline content) — ordinary tree nodes, so paths/marks/selection work unchanged; cell walls guard structural edits
- [x] Cell-aware selection; Tab/Shift+Tab + Enter navigation (grow at the edge); add/remove row/column/table via commands (hover chrome deferred to Phase 4)
- [x] Markdown export as GFM tables (first row = header, pipe escaping, `:-:`/`--:` column alignment via `setAlign` in a cell); HTML `thead/th` + `tbody/td`

## Phase 4 — Blocks as objects ✅ (done)

- [x] Hover gutter: `⠿` drag handle + `+` insert button (inserts a paragraph below with the slash menu pre-opened)
- [x] Drag-and-drop block reordering (`moveBlock` command with subtree, guards vs no-op/descendant/table structure; HTML5 DnD + drop indicator)
- [x] Click the handle to select the whole block (subtree text selection)
- [x] Esc block selection: selects the caret block subtree, repeated Esc escalates to the parent; typing/Backspace act on the whole block; stops at cell walls (native Shift+Arrow already extends across blocks)
- [x] Table chrome: caret-in-table toolbar (`TableMenu` widget) with +Row/+Col/−Row/−Col/✕ over the existing commands

## Formatting track (`formatting/SPEC.md`)

- [x] Boolean marks (bold/italic/code) + link; block alignment incl. justify (Phases 0–1)
- [x] Valued style marks: **text color, highlight, font size** (token-based) — replace-not-toggle semantics, HTML `<span style>` export, Markdown inline-HTML fallback (`styledText: 'plain'` to drop), bubble-menu palette
- [x] Font family (token set: default / serif / mono) — same valued-mark shape; Font row in the palette; HTML importer maps stacks back to tokens
- [x] Generic block indent for non-list blocks — **resolved: won't build.** Nesting (Tab in lists, `children`, gutter drag) is the mechanism; a flat indent attr would duplicate hierarchy (decision recorded in `formatting/SPEC.md`)
- [x] Custom color input in the palette (native pickers in the Text and Mark rows; bubble focus-guard extended so picker focus doesn't dismiss it)

## Ongoing / parallel track

- [x] HTML & Markdown **import**: `parseHTML` in core (inverse of the view; powers rich paste — clipboard HTML becomes real blocks, plain text stays the fallback) + `@custom-wysiwyg/import-markdown` (`parseMarkdown`, the exported GFM subset; inline HTML degrades to plain text). `insertBlocks` command splices pastes (inline for single paragraphs, split-and-insert otherwise; cell walls hold). Round-trip tested both ways
- [x] **Agent adapter** (`integration/PLAN.md`) — pipe proven + `@custom-wysiwyg/agent-adapter` + scripted demo session (first live LLM pass stays open there)
- [x] Publishing setup: all 7 packages publish-ready (real `^X.Y.Z` inter-package ranges — npm publishes `*` literally; `repository`/`publishConfig: public`; MIT LICENSE + per-package READMEs; tarballs verified via `npm pack --dry-run`), tag-triggered `publish.yml` workflow with provenance. Versioning decision: lockstep + `/cut-release` retained, changesets not adopted. Owner-side once: create the npm org `custom-wysiwyg` (unclaimed as of 2026-07) + add `NPM_TOKEN` secret
- [ ] Docs site (deferred — per-package READMEs + the root README cover usage for now)
- [x] Undo of input rules restores literal syntax (autoformat commits the literal
      text as its own undo step); inline link editor (in-bubble URL input with
      set/edit/remove, replacing `window.prompt`)
